/**
 * An offscreen block lets you create a temporary internal section that doesn't render until you're ready for it to.
 *
 * This method returns an intermediate object which can then render a row at a time using a buffer renderer:
 *
 * ```
 * val buffer = offscreen { ... }
 * val renderer = buffer.createRenderer()
 * while (true) {
 *   renderer.renderNextRow() // Adds offscreen commands to our current render scope
 *   textLine()
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * While the above code is useless as-is (it's identical to rendering directly to the current render scope), you can
 * query an offscreen buffer in order to do more useful things.
 *
 * For example, here we right-align a block of text:
 *
 * ```
 * val buffer = offscreen { ... }
 * val maxWidth = buffer.lineLengths.maxOrNull() ?: 0
 * val renderer = buffer.createRenderer()
 * content.lineLengths.forEach { lineLength ->
 *   repeat(maxWidth - lineLength) { text(' ') }
 *   renderer.renderNextRow()
 *   textLine()
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * *Note: Instead of doing that yourself, you may use the [justified] helper method instead.*
 *
 * The initial state for the offscreen buffer inherits the parent state, so that this would render green the first time
 * and blue the second:
 *
 * ```
 * val buffer = offscreen { textLine("Inherits color from parent") }
 *
 * green()
 * buffer.createRenderer().let { renderer1 ->
 *   ... render all rows, will be green ...
 * }
 *
 * blue()
 * buffer.createRenderer().let { renderer2 ->
 *   ... render all rows, will be blue ...
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * Despite initially inheriting the text effect state from the parent scope, you can also modify text effects *inside*
 * an offscreen render block, which would then remember that for that point on without affecting the parent state:
 *
 * ```
 * val buffer = offscreen {
 *   textLine("Red (from parent)")
 *   blue()
 *   textLine("Blue")
 *   textLine("Blue again")
 * }
 *
 * red()
 * val renderer = buffer.createRenderer()
 * while (renderer.hasNextRow()) {
 *   text("Red "); renderer.renderNextRow(); textLine( "Red")
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * This lets you do whatever you want within an offscreen render block without worrying about it leaking into the
 * parent scope.
 *
